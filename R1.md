## Log of Round 1 of #301DaysOfCode - beginning January 2019

### Day 1: January 3 2019 - Thursday

**Today's Progress:**

I was able to accomplish the following today:
  - create the rei account on the blog server
  - generate an ssh key for Rei
  - added the key to Digital Ocean
  - created the ssh connection to the blog server (user access only)
  - first mass commit of the base mycroft code

I do have an issue to figure out where the base code is in a boxy thing, and simply redirects to the primary repo window.
**Thoughts:**

It has taken a bit of getting used to. I didn't realise that there would be quite so much involved. An hour is an hour, but it is *just* an hour. You still have to do all of the paperwork and record-keeping, and the planning really cannot be part of that or you will lose efficiency with time.

Day 1: #301DaysOfCode Today was the beginning of account generation and a quick subcourse in both SSH and git. I hit a few snags but got around them.

### Day 2: January 4 2019 - Friday

**Today's Progress:**

I have decided to use this period in the beginning to create a few chatbots in node.js as they are part of the overall project, and they can be worked with independently of the foundational work. It looks as if I will be supplementing my knowledge with MongoDB.

To that end, I was able to accomplish the following today:

    - create a new server called *freenode* to handle the bots
    - successfully login to the server
    - installed zsh, got it configured, and added the wh account
    - installing node and npm on my local system
    - getting repos sorted out

**Thoughts:**

I felt like I wasted time, but I know deep down that it was a necessary evil.

Day 2: #301DaysOfCode Today was about node.js and building Discord bots to lead into what will be grown into our lovely full system. Start little and build on those successes.
