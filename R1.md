## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode - beginning November 2018

### Day 1: November 25. Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Spent time building the initial HTML5 format of my primary 
website. At the moment, it simply points to the blog, but I want a directional and
informational site that on one hand tells the things I want known about myself as
well as directs the viewer to the various sites and servers I have set up. I have
also learned how to connect font awesome to the site. 

**Thoughts:** Feels good to be back at coding.
