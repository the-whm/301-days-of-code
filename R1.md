## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode - beginning November 2018

### Day 1: November 25. Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Spent time building the initial HTML5 format of my primary 
website. At the moment, it simply points to the blog, but I want a directional and
informational site that on one hand tells the things I want known about myself as
well as directs the viewer to the various sites and servers I have set up. I have
also learned how to connect font awesome to the site. 

**Thoughts:** Feels good to be back at coding.

Site is not live yet.

### Day 2: November 26 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Still working on thee new website geetting the structure
together. Got a skeleton together and got it to serve on Chrome. Firefox not so 
much. 

**Thoughts:** Irritated and frustrated. But tomorrow will bring me more of a good 
chance to understand how this is all supposed to go togetheer and get the grids 
right.

### Day 3: November 27 Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** I went back and started everything from scratch. I have a 
better frameework than I had yesterday, although it all started out a bit 
frustrating. Now I am using a video by Traversy Media to help walk me through this, then I can tweak it later.

**Thoughts:** I feel better now that I have something to follow, although it is showing me some of the possible holes in FreeCodeCamp.
