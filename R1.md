## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode - beginning November 2018

### Day 1: November 25 2018 - Sunday

**Today's Progress:**
Spent time building the initial HTML5 format of my primary website. At the
moment, it simply points to the blog, but I want a directional and informational
site that on one hand tells the things I want known about myself as well as
directs the viewer to the various sites and servers I have set up. I have
also learned how to connect font awesome to the site.

**Thoughts:**
Feels good to be back at coding.

### Day 2: November 26 2018 - Monday

**Today's Progress:**
Still working on the new website getting the structure together. Got a skeleton
together and got it to serve on Chrome. Firefox not so much.

**Thoughts:** Irritated and frustrated. But tomorrow will bring me more of a good
chance to understand how this is all supposed to go together and get the grids
right.

### Day 3: November 27 2018 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** I went back and started everything from scratch. I have a
better framework than I had yesterday, although it all started out a bit
frustrating. Now I am using a video by Traversy Media to help walk me through
this, then I can tweak it later.

**Thoughts:** I feel better now that I have something to follow, although it is
showing me some of the possible holes in FreeCodeCamp.

### Day 4: November 28 Wednesday

 **Today's Progress:**
 I finally have the quad section in! It is a rather big
 deal for me, as I was not able to get this to work for life, love, or money
 before. I am also trying to get more of my work shifted to *Tintern*, which is
 my HP Fedora 29 based laptop.

 **Thoughts:**
 This way of thinking is now beginning to take hold in my normal job and I am
 shifting my viewpoints to thinking more in code than the typical server admin
 thought. It is helping me analyze things. I have also discovered that for some
 reason Atom will not allow me to write in anything other than American English.
 Whatever.

### Day 5: November 29 2018 - Thursday

**Today's Progress:**
I was able to create the other two pages for the website, and I also was able
to spin up two new servers for a coming project. Of course, I also had to name
them after the two AI entities in Neuromancer.

**Thoughts:**
Very excited that I am getting things done, and I am beginning to see the added
results in my daily work as I am looking at problems and issues that arise from
a more code-related perspective.
