**Thoughts:** Nice and easy. A good refresher. Trying to also convert the notes
in this log to Cymraeg as much as possible as I move along. By the end of this

### Day 3: November 26 2018, dydd Llun

**Today's Progress**: Executed dydd 3 from the website.

**Thoughts:** Quite a few of these works I already knew and were stored in my
brain, so they were quite easy to use again. The new words I gained were ones
that I really wanted to know, so that made it so much more fulfilling.

**Vocabulary:**
- Wales = Cymru
- And = a
- Language = iaith
- The language = yr iaith

### Day 4: November 27 2018, dydd Mawrth

**Today's Progress:**
Today was quite good. And I am writing this two days later, because I apparently
forgot to do so when I was in it earlier.

**Thoughts:**
I am pleased with the immersion that I am now getting in Cymraeg. I have been
doing a lot more listening to BBC Cymru and I know deep down that I cannot
deprive my little one of her heritage. It would also be really cool to be able
to speak to my family in our native language.

### Day 5: November 28 2018, dydd Iau

**Today's Progress:**
Today was the last of the daily lessons that SSiW provides, so now I am going to
have to think of something, which will most likely involve getting the full
subscription, which I am not too broken up about.

**Thoughts:**
I will most likely get the full learning package tonight. We'll see.
