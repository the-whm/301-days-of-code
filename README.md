The log of my 301 Days Of Code

[Round 1](R1.md) - January 3, 2019 - All Hallows Eve 2019

This round of development is to create the processes and the actual mechanism
that is Rei.

I am well aware that this project will take more than 301 days to complete, and
in fact I am planning in a 360 day cycle. This is six iterations of 60 days in
total. They break down in the following manner:

  - Iteration 1 - Days 1-60 - ![Baby Rei](images/baby-rei-2.jpeg)
  - Iteration 2 - Days 61-120 - ![Toddler Rei](images/toddler-rei-2.jpeg)
  - Iteration 3 - Days 121-180 - ![Child Rei](images/child-rei-2.jpeg)
  - Iteration 4 - Days 181-240 - ![Tween Rei](images/tween-rei-2.jpeg)
  - Iteration 5 - Days 241-300 - ![Teen Rei](images/teen-rei-2.jpeg)
  - Iteration 6 - Days 301-360 - ![Adult Rei](images/adult-rei-2.jpg)  


Rei is my personal assistant, and among the various functions she will execute
are:
 - Maintenance and update of servers
 - Reporting of daily status of said servers
 - Secretarial Functions
    - Scheduling
    - Email and Communications assessment
    - Assistance in writing documents for web and publication
    - Garnering information as requested
    - Nag and help with health related things (mental and physical)
    - Financial advice

## Parameters

 - There will be several stages of development, and they might run concurrent
 to one another
    - User creation phase
    - Core Support Process Phases
